Hi! I am Erbol. Welcome to my personal website! 

I know it seems quite outdated, but I decided to put everything here rather than posting in other social medias. Anyway I am not seeking any attention, so my posts will be noticed by only those of you, who proactively check this website.

You can notice main sections from the navigation menu.

- ***notes*** - I will keep here small (somethimes maybe big, if I am not lazy) notes about everything. This is basically my blog
- ***projects*** - in this section I will write about my own pet projects. They are mainly about robotics, since I guess I am still a kid inside. 
- ***about*** - just some information about me. So far it's just a copy of my linkedin. Maybe I will update that in the future.


If you have any questions or comments, just shoot me an <a href="mailto:mail@erbol.me">email</a> (yeah, I am closer to boomers than to Z) or message me on telegram <a href="https://t.me/username">`@b01ix`</a>.
