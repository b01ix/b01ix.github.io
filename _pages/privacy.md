### Privacy policy

Just like most websites, I also use cookies, which gives me the opportunity to improve my website (just kidding, it does not help me at all, and I really do not care about your data, do not use it, I do this just because of EU regulations).


#### What are cookies?
For some reason, the British call them “biscuits.” But Internet cookies are slightly different. A cookie is a data fragment from a website you have visited that is stored on your computer. 


#### Which cookies do I use and why?
I may use Google Analytics to collect statistics, as it is important for me to know how people read me. Based on this data, I can understand the size of my audience, and what I am doing right or wrong.


#### What should you do if you don't want to use cookies?
You can disable them using your browser’s security settings. An important note: the settings should be applied to all browsers you use (both on your computer and smartphone). Please note, if you choose to disable cookies, nothing changes and nobody cares.
